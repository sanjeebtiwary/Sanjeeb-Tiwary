										<p> My journey has been quite a rollercoaster ride, starting with a solid foundation in Computer Science and Electronics. I've had the privilege of contributing to the Microsoft Student Community as a Machine Learning Developer and interning as a Junior Data Scientist at Zummit Infolabs. These experiences gave me a deep dive into the world of real-time data optimization, complex machine learning models, and even some mind-bending mathematics algorithms. Plus, my active involvement in the TensorFlow User Group and open-source development has been a thrilling learning curve, proving my commitment to constant growth and giving back to the tech community. It's been a whirlwind of experiences that have shaped me into a well-rounded data scientist.</p>
										<p>when it comes to the technical side of things, I've got quite the toolkit. From C++ to Python, SQL to NoSQL, and even some AWS, I've got a versatile set of skills up my sleeve. Whether it's optimizing server performance or crafting data-driven solutions, I've got the tools for the job. Certifications like Generative AI from Google Cloud and other achievements are like badges of honor, proving my mettle in the world of technology and data analysis.</p>
										<p>But it's not just about the tech; it's about how you use it. My knack for problem-solving, critical thinking, and effective communication is what makes the real difference. These skills are like my secret sauce for translating complex data insights into actionable solutions. I'm all about continuous improvement, which is why you'll find me participating in specialized training sessions, workshops, and programs like the AWS Cloud Administrator. Oh, and my publications, like the Queue Waiting Time Dataset and that conference paper on Algae Growth Prediction? They're proof that I'm dedicated to pushing the boundaries of knowledge and contributing to the greater scientific community. With accolades like being certified as a Google Analytics pro, I'm all set to excel in data-driven roles and make a meaningful impact.</p>
